== Installation ==

*   Go to __WordPress Admin__ > __Plugins__ > __Add New__ from the left-hand menu
*   In the search box type __Paystack WooCommerce Payment Gateway__
*   Click on Install now when you see __Paystack WooCommerce Payment Gateway__ to install the plugin
*   After installation, __activate__ the plugin.


= Paystack Setup and Configuration =
*   Go to __WooCommerce > Settings__ and click on the __Payments__ tab
*   You'll see Paystack listed along with your other payment methods. Click __Set Up__
*   On the next screen, configure the plugin. There is a selection of options on the screen. Read what each one does below.

1. __Enable/Disable__ - Check this checkbox to Enable Paystack on your store's checkout
2. __Title__ - This will represent Paystack on your list of Payment options during checkout. It guides users to know which option to select to pay with Paystack. __Title__ is set to "Debit/Credit Cards" by default, but you can change it to suit your needs.
3. __Description__ - This controls the message that appears under the payment fields on the checkout page. Use this space to give more details to customers about what Paystack is and what payment methods they can use with it.
4. __Test Mode__ - Check this to enable test mode. When selected, the fields in step six will say "Test" instead of "Live." Test mode enables you to test payments before going live. The orders process with test payment methods, no money is involved so there is no risk. You can uncheck this when your store is ready to accept real payments.
5. __Payment Option__ - Select how Paystack Checkout displays to your customers. A popup displays Paystack Checkout on the same page, while Redirect will redirect your customer to make payment.
6. __API Keys__ - The next two text boxes are for your Paystack API keys, which you can get from your Paystack Dashboard. If you enabled Test Mode in step four, then you'll need to use your test API keys here. Otherwise, you can enter your live keys.
7. __Additional Settings__ - While not necessary for the plugin to function, there are some extra configuration options you have here. You can do things like add custom metadata to your transactions (the data will show up on your Paystack dashboard) or use Paystack's [Split Payment feature](https://paystack.com/docs/payments/split-payments). The tooltips next to the options provide more information on what they do.
8. Click on __Save Changes__ to update the settings.

To account for poor network connections, which can sometimes affect order status updates after a transaction, we __strongly__ recommend that you set a Webhook URL on your Paystack dashboard. This way, whenever a transaction is complete on your store, we'll send a notification to the Webhook URL, which will update the order and mark it as paid. You can set this up by using the URL in red at the top of the Settings page. Just copy the URL and save it as your webhook URL on your Paystack dashboard under __Settings > API Keys & Webhooks__ tab.

If you do not find Paystack on the Payment method options, please go through the settings again and ensure that:

*   You've checked the __"Enable/Disable"__ checkbox
*   You've entered your __API Keys__ in the appropriate field
*   You've clicked on __Save Changes__ during setup
